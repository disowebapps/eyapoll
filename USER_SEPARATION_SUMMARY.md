# User Separation Implementation Summary

## Overview
The system has been completely separated into distinct user types with their own tables, models, authentication guards, and routes.

## User Types & Tables

### 1. Voters (users table)
- **Model**: `App\Models\User`
- **Table**: `users`
- **Guard**: `web`
- **Routes**: `/voter/*`
- **Capabilities**: Vote in elections, view results

### 2. Candidates (candidates_users table)
- **Model**: `App\Models\CandidateUser`
- **Table**: `candidates_users`
- **Guard**: `candidate`
- **Routes**: `/candidate/*`
- **Capabilities**: Vote in elections, apply as candidate, manage applications

### 3. Admins (admins table)
- **Model**: `App\Models\Admin`
- **Table**: `admins`
- **Guard**: `admin`
- **Routes**: `/admin/*`
- **Capabilities**: Manage elections, approve users, system administration

### 4. Observers (observers table)
- **Model**: `App\Models\Observer`
- **Table**: `observers`
- **Guard**: `observer`
- **Routes**: `/observer/*`
- **Capabilities**: View audit logs, monitor elections, export data

## Database Changes

### New Tables Created:
- `admins` - Admin users
- `observers` - Observer users
- `candidates_users` - Candidate users (already existed, updated)

### Updated Tables:
- `users` - Now only contains voters (role column removed)
- `vote_tokens` - Added `user_type` column for polymorphic relationships
- `audit_logs` - Added `user_type` column for polymorphic relationships
- `candidates` - Updated to reference `candidate_user_id` instead of `user_id`

### Foreign Key Updates:
- `elections.created_by` now references `admins.id`
- `candidates.approved_by` now references `admins.id`
- `users.approved_by` now references `admins.id`

## Authentication System

### Guards Configuration:
```php
'guards' => [
    'web' => ['driver' => 'session', 'provider' => 'users'],
    'admin' => ['driver' => 'session', 'provider' => 'admins'],
    'candidate' => ['driver' => 'session', 'provider' => 'candidates'],
    'observer' => ['driver' => 'session', 'provider' => 'observers'],
]
```

### Providers Configuration:
```php
'providers' => [
    'users' => ['driver' => 'eloquent', 'model' => App\Models\User::class],
    'admins' => ['driver' => 'eloquent', 'model' => App\Models\Admin::class],
    'candidates' => ['driver' => 'eloquent', 'model' => App\Models\CandidateUser::class],
    'observers' => ['driver' => 'eloquent', 'model' => App\Models\Observer::class],
]
```

## Route Structure

### Admin Routes (`/admin/*`)
- Login/Logout with admin guard
- Dashboard
- User management (voters)
- Candidate management
- Observer management
- Election management
- System settings

### Candidate Routes (`/candidate/*`)
- Login/Logout with candidate guard
- Dashboard
- Profile management
- Election applications
- Voting capabilities

### Observer Routes (`/observer/*`)
- Login/Logout with observer guard
- Dashboard
- Audit log viewing
- Election monitoring
- Data export

### Voter Routes (`/voter/*`)
- Login/Logout with web guard
- Dashboard
- Profile management
- Voting capabilities

## Controllers Created

### Authentication Controllers:
- `AdminAuthController` - Admin authentication
- `CandidateAuthController` - Candidate authentication
- `ObserverAuthController` - Observer authentication
- `VoterAuthController` - Voter authentication

## Model Relationships Updated

### Polymorphic Relationships:
- `VoteToken` model now supports multiple user types
- `AuditLog` model now supports multiple user types

### Updated Foreign Keys:
- Election creator references Admin
- Candidate approver references Admin
- User approver references Admin

## Migration Files

### Key Migrations:
1. `2025_01_20_000000_finalize_user_separation.php` - Final separation migration
2. `2025_09_20_105133_separate_user_types_completely.php` - Initial separation
3. `2025_09_19_212157_create_admins_table.php` - Admin table
4. `2025_09_19_212207_create_candidates_users_table.php` - Candidate users table

## Security Features

### Separate Authentication:
- Each user type has its own authentication guard
- Separate login forms and processes
- Isolated session management

### Access Control:
- Route-level protection with specific guards
- Model-level permissions
- Status-based access control

## Registration System

### Registration Routes:
- `/register` - Choose user type
- `/register/voter` - Voter registration
- `/register/candidate` - Candidate registration

### Admin/Observer Registration:
- Handled through admin panel
- Requires admin approval

## Benefits of This Separation

1. **Security**: Complete isolation between user types
2. **Scalability**: Each user type can be scaled independently
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new user types or modify existing ones
5. **Performance**: Optimized queries for specific user types
6. **Compliance**: Better audit trails and access control

## Next Steps

1. Update existing views to work with new models
2. Test authentication flows for all user types
3. Update any remaining references to the old unified User model
4. Run migrations to apply database changes
5. Update any existing data to fit the new structure
