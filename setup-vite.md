# Vite Setup Complete

## What was changed:

### 1. Package.json Updated
- Added Alpine.js as a dev dependency
- All CDN dependencies are now managed locally

### 2. JavaScript Setup
- Updated `resources/js/app.js` to import and initialize Alpine.js
- Removed all CDN script tags from layouts

### 3. CSS Setup  
- Enhanced `resources/css/app.css` with comprehensive styles
- Added missing utility classes and responsive styles
- Included font loading and base styles

### 4. Layout Files Updated
All layout files now use `@vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])` instead of CDN links:
- `app.blade.php`
- `admin.blade.php` 
- `guest.blade.php`
- `auth.blade.php`
- `voting.blade.php`
- `voter.blade.php`

## Next Steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Build Assets
For development:
```bash
npm run dev
```

For production:
```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. Update CSP (if needed)
Remove CDN references from Content Security Policy headers in:
- `voter.blade.php` (line 6)

## Benefits:
- ✅ Faster loading (no external CDN dependencies)
- ✅ Better caching and versioning
- ✅ Offline capability
- ✅ Hot module replacement in development
- ✅ Optimized production builds
- ✅ Better security (no external script loading)

## Development Workflow:
1. Run `npm run dev` for development with hot reloading
2. Make changes to CSS/JS files in `resources/`
3. Changes will be automatically reflected in browser
4. Run `npm run build` before deploying to production
